# composition-api

This project aims to demonstrate the key differences between the Vue.js Options API and Composition API. Through the creation of this small project, I could gain a foundational understanding of how Vue.js with Composition API works.

By exploring the basics of both APIs, I can have a deeper understanding of how to use Vue.js effectively in my web development projects.

Through this project, I could learn the skills necessary to create scalable, maintainable, and efficient Vue.js applications using the Composition API. This project is was an excellent opportunity to broaden my understanding of Vue.js and improve my proficiency in using it.
